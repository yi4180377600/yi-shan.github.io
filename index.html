<h1>Yi Shan</h1>

<p>I&#39;m a third-year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at ENS Paris, majoring in number theory. My advisor is Professor <a href="http://gaetan.chenevier.perso.math.cnrs.fr/">Ga&euml;tan Chenevier</a>. Now I am interested in automorphic representations and related topics. Before that,&nbsp;I obtained my bachelor&#39;s degree at the School of Mathematical Sciences at USTC (University of Science and Technology of China) and&nbsp;obtained my master&#39;s degree at Sorbonne University (Paris 6).</p>
